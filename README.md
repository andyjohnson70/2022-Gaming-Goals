# 2022-Gaming-Goals
Andy Johnson's personal website to track his gaming goals for 2022

# Website outline
- React
- Intro landing page which gives an overview of all the games included
- Interactive panels for each game that will display my goal and a way to mark it as completed (maybe I can have a section to upload video/screenshot of obtaining it?)

# Draft of goal list
1. TFT - get diamond in each set (masters if im feeling frisky)
2. Slay the Spire - Ascension 20 for each character
3. Pokemon Legends: Areceus - KILL GOD
4. Super Mario 64 (?) - sub 22/21/20 minute 16 star speedrun
5. Chess - 1100/1200 ELO on chess.com
